# SoCS SU REPS WEB BLOG

The SoCS SU Reps Web Blog has been created to provide an open and free space to ask any questions from any of the School Reps or Course Resp. It will be a central repository of comments through the year as well as a guide for further course reps. The content will be created entirely by the course reps and free from any influence of the University of Lincoln SoCS. The aim here being to keep this space completely neutral and to help provide the best quality feedback to the SoCS so that as reps we can make this the best school as possible. 

## Overview

This website has been created using the most basis of HTML/CSS/JS. The limited JS used in the site is purely to collate posts onto a single page and make t easier for contributers to link there blogs without having to go to several different pages. 

The reason to keep the site as simple as possible was to encourage as many contributors as possible who may not yet have experience in open source collaboration, who may not be familiar with the Git process or familiar with web design in general. 

This project then provides a very easy way to start your journey on software development using these tools. 

## Note on Feedback

It should be noted that on the Feedback section of the web site we use Google Forms. We have used these so we have some way to collate results without requiring a user to provide any details at all and also so we (SU School & Course Reps) can review the comments and provide the most constructive feedback to the school. Google Forms here works well for this. However, user be warned that anyone with a '@lincolnsu.com' email address can also view these results. 

Even though there are no details kept at all of who has provided feedback through the survey please do not use any names or personal details in the feedback.  

## How to Contribute to the Web Site

Contributing to the website is easy and we encourage all persons who are interested to raise any issues and make pull requests. 

The general process of contributing on GitHub is widely documented however the outline process is below:

1. Identify where you want to host the project locally. This could be a projects folder for example. 

1. Clone the repository using GitHub desktop of the CLI into this location (CLI is recommended as this helps you become more familiar with Git in general)

1. If you are using a Text editor such as Sublime then the best place to sdtart is by opening the 'index.html' file using Sublime or Vim.

1. To see the website locally you can either drag and drop the 'index/html' file inot your browser bar or rightclick the file and selecet 'open with [your browser of choice]'.

1. Now make an edit to the index.html file and then refresh your browser to see the edit take effect

1. Now, if you want you can make a pull request but that is for the reader to investigate. However, all good pull requests start life in their own branch - never push to Main directly!

That's it really. Nothing more to it for a project of this nature.
