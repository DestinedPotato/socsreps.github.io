    <h2>Course Rep AMA with Luke Powell</h2>
    <h5 style="color:grey">June 21, 2020 by Garry Clawson</h5>

    <p>Luke was a 3rd year Course Rep in 19/20 and today kindly donated his time and experience to have have an Ask Me Anything (AMA) discussion with the new SoCS course reps. Luke was extremely insightful and offered lots of ideas and suggestions about to how make yourself visible to as many students as possible, as well as offering ideas on how to best deal with student concerns or problems. Luke also offered insights into the day to day role of being a course rep as well as what meetings reps attended and what they were like. Thanks Luke for a great session, we all learned a lot!</p>
