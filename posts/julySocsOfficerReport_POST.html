    <h2>July SoCS Officer Report</h2>
    <h5 style="color:grey">June 22, 2020 by Garry Clawson</h5>

    <p>By the 3rd Wednesday of every month it is the duty of the SoCS School Rep to provide a report to the student union about what has been achieved in the month, what wins the reps have had and what the plans are for the following month. These reports are all freely available and can be found at <a href="https://www.lincolnsu.com/officer-reports">www.lincolnsu.com/officer-reports</a>. For added transparency I will also publish the submitted reports each month as a post, the first of which is the <a href="posts/reports/July2020_SoCS_Officer_Report.pdf">July 2020 SoCS Officer Report</a>. We would love to hear any feedback and remember no concern or idea is to small. </p>
