    <h5>To make sure we have the most up to date feedback as possible we will each month take a short survey that you can complete at any time through that month. We will use the ongoing feedback to help us inform the SoCS leadership team on what areas can be improved and what areas are going well. We will change the questions to make sure they are relevant and you can also get any question you want asked by emailing us or raising a Issue on our GitHub. </h5>

    <h5>We want to make sure that only the most relevant and useful questions are being presented as this is what will be given back to the School. Click on the 'Feedback' button in the navigation bar to provide your feedback, results will be published each month in the blog.</h5>
