    <p>The course reps get asked many questions and some of them require the same support. This can include things such as sign posting, inquiring on help or support or even ways to give feedback about a lecture. To help with this we have put together this FAQs. If you want to add an FAQ then please email us or raise an issue on our GitHub.

<!-- FAQs -->

<div class="faq">
    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 16px">What are the best ways to contact my course rep?</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>There are several ways to contact your course reps but the best way is via email. All course reps emails can be found in the Contact Us section of this website which is found at the top of every web page of this site. Alternately, all rep contact details are on the LincolnSU website.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 16px">How do I find out what the course reps have been up to?</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>The School Rep creates a monthly report which includes all the activities that the school and course reps have been up to. This report is available to all students on the LincolnSU website and is completed by the 3rd Wednesday of every month. Every report is archived and located at <a href="https://www.lincolnsu.com/officer-reports">www.lincolnsu.com/officer-reports</a>. Click on the Archive tab to see all past reports. Additionally, for current information this SoCS reps blog is also a useful place to catch up or contact your reps who will always be very happy to answer any questions. No idea or concern is too small.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 16px">If I have a suggestion about a lecture or module who do I contact?</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>The best first contact is the module coordinator. However, the course reps are able to represent any concern you have on your behalf to the school or module coordinators but this should ideally be done if you are not happy with your previous contact. A good way to let us know of an idea is also via <a href="https://lincolnsu.com/course-mate">www.lincolnsu.com/course-mate</a>. Here you can formally (through the SU website) submit any feedback about your course and the reps will pick this up via the SU. </p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 16px">What if I need help with my course work?</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>The course reps are not directly able to help you with any course work or assignments. However, they are able to give you ideas of who best to contact for any help. Often, a quick discussion with the module coordinators can help clarify any problems.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 16px">Can I contact a course rep anonymously?</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>Yes. There are many times when you may want to raise an issue in an anonymous way. We have provided for this by including a Feedback section to this website which does not require any personal details to complete. The feedback page link can be found at the top of every web page across the site. This feedback form will always have a section where you can give written feedback. To contact us just fill in the form (you don't have to fill all sections so just fill the one you want) and click submit.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 16px">Can I request a meeting with a course rep?</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>You can request a meeting with your course rep at any time. As matter of fact, you can just send them an email or stop them when you see them if you want to talk about anything or raise an idea. If you want a meeting then just drop one of us an email and we would be glad to arrange this with you. We are here to help you so please come and speak to us. </p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 16px">Do I contact a course rep if I have a medical problem?</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>There is no reason to tell the course reps if you have a medical problem. If you have concerns about your wellbeing a useful place to start is with the Lincoln SU Wellbeing team. They can offer lots of advice as well as signpost further areas of support.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible" style="font-size: 16px">If I am not happy with my grades can a course rep get them changed?</button>
    <div class="content">
    <p>Unfortunately not. If you have a query or concern with your grades then you should speak with the module coordinators or contact your Personal Tutor.</p>
